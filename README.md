<h1 style="font-weight:bold;">Leslie's Newsletter Archive</h1>
<p>A simple archive of articles that I've sent out to my company's marketing team bi-weekly as part of industry research.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Background</h2>
<p>What began as a side project during my internship at Leslieâ€™s has grown into a tool that team members regularly use to stay up to date with marketing trends and industry research relevant to our business.</p> 
<p>During our free-time, a colleague and I collected articles that we'd submit into an AirTable backlog for each other to review. Then every 2 weeks, we selected at least 2-3 articles to feature in a newsletter sent to the marketing team.
  Each digest included a main summary highlighting key takeaways and emerging trends, followed by individual article summaries and links.

<p>The purpose of this website is to make it easy for my company's marketing team to find all the articles and  pieces of research I've shared with them in one convenient place.</p>
